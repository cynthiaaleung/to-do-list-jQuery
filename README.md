# To-Do List
## Project Description

This is an assignment for "The Complete Guide to jQuery" course on Educative.io. The main objective is to practise using jQuery and AJAX. Users can make a GET request to a mock api to display tasks, add their own tasks, mark tasks as done and also delete tasks. 

## What I learned from this assignment

  - event bubbling and stop propogation
  - event handlers
  - traversing through the DOM tree
  - add, modify, and delete DOM elements
  - effects: visibility, fading, sliding, animations
  - callback functions for effects and animations
  - chaining different effects
  - AJAX GET and POST methods in jQuery

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, HTML, SCSS

## Final Product

### GET request to a mock api
When the user clicks the "server" button, a GET request will be made to a mock api and the tasks will be displayed in the "To Do" section.

### Add a new task
Users can type in the input box and click the "add" button to add that task to the "To Do" section.

### Mark a task as completed
Here the new "update resume" task has been added to the "To Do" section. Users can move a task (e.g. "reply to emails") to the "Done" section by clicking the checkmark button beside the task. The user will then see a fading out and in effect as the task gets moved to the "Done" section.

### Delete a task
Users can delete a task (e.g. "reply to emails") by clicking the delete button beside the task and it will be completely removed.
